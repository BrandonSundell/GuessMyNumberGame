# GuessMyNumberGame
A simple guessing game with two game modes. 
1. The user thinks of a number between 1-100 and the computer tries to guess the users number
2. The computer picks a number between 1-1,000 and the user tries to guess the number 

Along with a bisection algorithm I was practicing for insight on how to go about making the game.
